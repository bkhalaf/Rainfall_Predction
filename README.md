# Rainfall_Predction
Implementing different ML models to predict rainfall tomorrow based on historical data for 30 years old.

Rainfall prediction is one of the challenging and uncertain tasks which has a significant impact on several environmental aspects mainly on groundwater dynamics, agriculture, and fishing.  on human society. Timely and accurate predictions can help to proactively reduce human and financial loss. This study presents a set of experiments which involve the use of prevalent precise machine learning techniques to build models to predict whether it is going to rain tomorrow or not based on weather data for that day in the Gaza strip in Palestine. major cities of Australia. This comparative study is conducted concentrating on three aspects: modeling inputs, modeling methods, and pre-processing techniques. The results provide a comparison of various evaluation metrics of these machine learning models and their reliability to predict the rainfall by analyzing the weather data.
