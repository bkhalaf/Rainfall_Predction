# Rainfall_Predction
Implementing different ML models to predict rainfall tomorrow based on historical data for 30 years old.

Rainfall prediction is one of the challenging and uncertain tasks which has a significant impact on several environmental aspects mainly on groundwater dynamics, agriculture, and fishing.  on human society. Timely and accurate predictions can help to proactively reduce human and financial loss. This study presents a set of experiments which involve the use of prevalent precise machine learning techniques to build models to predict whether it is going to rain tomorrow or not based on weather data for that day in the Gaza strip in Palestine. major cities of Australia. This comparative study is conducted concentrating on three aspects: modeling inputs, modeling methods, and pre-processing techniques. The results provide a comparison of various evaluation metrics of these machine learning models and their reliability to predict the rainfall by analyzing the weather data.


# Case Study
In this paper, the data set under consideration contains daily weather observations from numerous Palestinian weather stations. The target variable is RainTomorrow which means: Did it rain the next day? Yes or No. The data set consists of 12 features and 12.987 k instances. 

Feature	Description
Date	The date of observation
Longitude	The coordinates of the location of the weather station
Latitude 	The coordinates of the location of the weather station
Elevation	The elevation of the location of the weather station
Max temperature 	The maximum temperature in degrees Celsius
Min temperature 	The minimum temperature in degrees Celsius
Precipitation 	The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm
Wind	The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
Relative humidity 	Humidity (percent) at 9am
Solar	The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day
Rain Today	1 if precipitation exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0
Rain Tomorrow 	The target variable. Did it rain tomorrow?
